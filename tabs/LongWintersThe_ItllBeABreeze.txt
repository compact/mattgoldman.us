With lyrics:

Verse 1:

G    a       C                         
 This fall I don't know if I survived 
  C       a        G
I woke up still on fire. 
        C
Are you saying I'm still alive
           a
Is it your kisses I'm feeling?

Verse 2:

G    a           C
       These are pieces I didn't know I had
       C         a        G
Each a different shade of blinding
          C
These are pieces you left behind
        a
Not the pieces that fit with mine

Chorus:

G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C
  Is it your kisses I'm feeling?
G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C                    C
  Is it your kisses I'm feeling?

Bridge:
e   a
	  I am a tree
e   a                            G
            Build a nest in my hair
e   a 
      Your voice appeals to me
e   a                            C
            It's exactly how I feel
G       D     
  Do do do do do
G      D     G
 Do do do do do
G      D        C
 Do do do do do do

Chorus:

G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C
  Is it your kisses I'm feeling?
G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C                    C
  Is it your kisses I'm feeling?

Verse 3:
G    a      C
 I'm fading in and out
    C
And I don't mind
  C              a        G
I try to let you know I'm fine
          C
And I can hear you crying
          a
And I can hear you crying

Chorus:

G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C
  Is it your kisses I'm feeling?
G          D        G         D
It'll be a breeze
a            C                    C
