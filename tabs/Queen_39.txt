        D                             Em
In the year of thirty-nine assembled here the volunteers
        C              G         D
In the days when the lands were few
         Em         Em7          C
And the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
     Dsus4    D         G
The sweetest sight ever seen.


         D                           B7                       
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
      Em        F#m/E Gm/E Am               
The score brave souls inside
     G                             D
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
  C          Em     C    D       C     G  D
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried


           G                          C         G
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
           G      C   G   D
Don't you hear me calling you
            G      B7      Em
Write your letters in the sand
 Em7     C     G         Am
For the day I take your hand
       Em7          D                G
In the land that our grandchildren knew


        D                          Em
In the year of thirty-nine came a ship in from the blue
        C             G         D
The volunteers came home that day
         Em         Em7         C
And they bring good news from a world so newly born
             Dsus4     D       G
Though their hearts so heavily weigh


          D                           B7       
For the earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
       Em     F#m/E Gm/E Am   
But my love this cannot be
        G                            D 
For so many years have gone but I'm older but a year
    C      Em       C       D       	C   G       D
Your mother's eyes from your eyes - cry to me


           G                          C         G
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
           G      C   G   D
Don't you hear me calling you
            G      B7      Em
Write your letters in the sand
Em7     C     G         Am
For the day I take your hand
       Em7           D             G   D
In the land that our grandchildren knew

           G                          C         G
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
           G      C   G   D
Don't you hear me calling you
          G      B7      Em
All your letters in the sand
Em      C       G              Am
Can not heal me like your your hand
       Em7          D          G
For my life, still ahead, pity me
