# 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall
I programmed a Lego Mindstorms NXT to display the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer
on the Wall" while also playing the music.  This is probably one of my favorite
things that I've ever programmed, because I got the proper number of syllables
to play for each number.  View the code on [Github](https://github.com/robotmlg/99-bottles-of-robotc).
