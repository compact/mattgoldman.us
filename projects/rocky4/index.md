# Rocky IV
This is a robotic hand constructed from Lego Minstorms NXT that plays Rock,
Paper, Scissors against a human opponent.  It was built by my friend and co-worker
Morgan van Blarcum, and programmed by me in the summer of 2013.

Here's a video I made to show off Rocky IV.  It's better than trying to explain it:

View the source code on my [Github](https://github.com/robotmlg/rocky-iv).  The include file is just a library to communicate
with the accelerometer used to read the player's hand position.  It's from the
[RobotC Driver Suite](http://botbench.com/blog/robotc-driver-suite/) written by
[Xander Soldaat at BotBench.com](http://botbench.com/blog/robotc-driver-suite/).
