# Rocky IV
This is a robotic hand constructed from Lego Minstorms NXT that plays Rock,
Paper, Scissors against a human opponent.  It was built by my friend and co-worker
Morgan van Blarcum, and programmed by me in the summer of 2013.

Here's a video I made to show off Rocky IV.  It's better than trying to explain it:

And here's the main source code.  The include file is just a library to communicate
with the accelerometer used to read the player's hand position.  It's from the
