Yes I know I'm a week late with this post, don't @ me.
## Travel
Lotta traveling since the last post
### Outer Banks
Went with my family on our annual vacation to the Outer Banks, NC.  Big highlight
there was climbing Cape Hatteras Light:

*The scar through the woods from when they
[moved the lighthouse](https://99percentinv
isible.org/episode/managed-retreat/) is still clearly visible.  The original 
position of the lighthouse was next to the grassy patch on the beach.*

### Chicago
Went to Chicago to visit family.  Going through TSA before the flight out,
we noticed a six-pack of beer that the TSA had seized (Sixpoint Resin IPA, so 
this was some good stuff).  This inspired me to create a drinking game:

#### The TSA Six-Pack Challenge

You need:
- a six pack of beer
- a friend
- plane tickets for you and your friend

Setup:
Take your six pack and get in the TSA security line. You'll want to keep it 
hidden until after you go through the ID/boarding pass check

Game start:
The game begins when the TSA agent tells you that you can't bring the beer on 
the plane.

Win Criteria:
- Drink three beers
- Get through security
- Put your shoes back on
- Get all your luggage and personal effects off the belt

*(Matt will not be held responsible for any penalties, legal or otherwise,
incurred to players of the game.  Drink responsibly.)*

Also, stopped by the [Museum of Science and Industry](https://msichicago.org)

*Could've spent the whole afternoon pressing this button repeatedly.  Sound of a
Tesla coil in and whistle from the coal mine in the background*

## Video Game Corner
Also spent the past month playing more video games that usual. Here's some highlights:
### Donut County
This is a very funny light puzzle game where you portray a hole controlled by a raccoon. I don't really want to say more that that. Pick it up on PC/Mac for $13 or iOS for $5
### Overcooked 2
Adds the key featuring missing in the original Overcooked: online multiplayer.
Of course, I haven't actually tried that out yet, so it might be crap for all I
know.  I bought this on Switch, and it's clearly just a lousy PC port (UI the 
wrong size, awkward menu controls).  Get this on PC and you'll be much happier.
(I have the original on PC, and it's great.)
### Mario Kart 8
It's Mario Kart.  It's great.

## Running
I've only gone for one run since the last blog post; it's just been too hot and
  humid.  Today it was 70 degrees, and I was just about to go for a run when it
  started raining.  I swear I'm not making excuses.
