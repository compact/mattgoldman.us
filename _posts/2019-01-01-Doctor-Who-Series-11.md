1. E11 - Resolution
2. E06 - Demons of the Punjab
2. E07 - Kerblam!
3. E10 - The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos
4. E04 - Arachnids in the UK
5. E03 - Rosa
6. E05 - The Tsurunga Conundrum
7. E09 - It Takes You Away
8. E08 - The Witchfinders
9. E01 - The Woman Who Fell to Earth
10. E02 - The Ghost Monument

_Resolutions_ is the top, but that's not really saying much considering how weak the competition is.  Here's hoping for a better series 12.  Jodie Whittaker is _killing it_ though, so I'm looking forward to it.
