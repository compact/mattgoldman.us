As a project for my operating systems class at Rutgers (198:416), we were assigned
to create a simple shell with I/O piping.  I learned a lot in the completion
of this project, specifically how I/O piping actually works on an OS level.

The code for this project can be found [on my Github page](https://github.com/robotmlg/simple-shell).
